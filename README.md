Welcome! This app produces recipes made from in-season ingredients. A user can enter their zip code and the date and will be able to seelct an ingredient that grows in their local USDA hardiness zone. Then, thanks to the Edamam recipe app, the app will give the user a random recipe using their chosen ingredient. 

Happy cooking!
